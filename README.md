This project demonstrates the use of a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model to predict song lyrics based on input text. It showcases natural language processing (NLP) techniques, text preprocessing, and neural network training using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding, and sequencing of song lyrics for model input.
- **LSTM Model**: Implementation of an LSTM network for sequence prediction.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model on a lyrics dataset and evaluating its performance.
- **Sample Predictions**: Generating lyrics predictions based on user input.
